# Reflection

In this exercise, I learned more about using GitHub when collaborating with others. I did not have much experience with pull requests in GitHub beforehand and did not know how they would differ from alternatives like Azure DevOps. Beyond that, I already knew most of what we were tasked to do, so I did not learn anything new about Git or GitHub.

My experience with collaboration in GitHub was highly informative. For instance, in Azure DevOps, comments on a pull request will actively prevent the pull request from being finalized until they are resolved. However, in GitHub, comments can serve as feedback or notes, allowing those responsible for approving the request to approve it without worrying about comments.
